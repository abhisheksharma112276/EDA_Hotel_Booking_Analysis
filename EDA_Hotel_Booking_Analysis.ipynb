        "I initiated the Hotel Booking Analysis project on October 8, 2023, and created a GitHub repository named \"EDA_Hotel Booking Analysis.\" The project was launched on the same day, and I made several commits to the repository, including a README file, the \"hotel booking.csv\" dataset, and a Google Colab notebook for analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the second day of the project, I set up the environment and began structuring the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) templates. I defined the project's name, added a GitHub link to the Colab notebook, and wrote a problem statement for the analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first step in my EDA project involved importing the necessary libraries for analysis. I imported pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn, which are essential for data manipulation and visualization.\n",
        "\n",
        "To access the dataset, I mapped the Colab notebook to my Google Drive. Using the pandas function pd.read_csv, I imported the data from a specific path. This function imported the data as a pandas DataFrame, which is a tabular data structure with rows (axis=0) and columns (axis=1). To get a sense of the data, I used pd.head() to view the first five rows and all the columns. Additionally, I used pd.info to obtain information about data types and the values stored in each feature. Using the .shape attribute, I checked the number of rows and columns in the DataFrame. I also identified and removed duplicate rows to ensure accurate analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, I checked for any missing values (NaN) in the dataset. The \"company\" column had more than 90% missing values, so I decided to remove that feature entirely. Afterward, I removed rows with any NaN values, ensuring the dataset was clean. Additionally, I converted the data types of \"agent\" and \"children\" from float to integer.\n",
        "\n",
        "I noticed that the \"children\" feature contained many 0 values. To determine whether these values were accurate, I applied a condition that returned a new DataFrame with rows where \"children,\" \"babies,\" and \"adults\" were not equal to 0.\n",
        "\n",
        "To gain a deeper understanding of the dataset, I used pd.describe to generate descriptive statistics for the features with continuous data. This provided insights into the mean, maximum, minimum, standard deviation, and other statistical measures for numerical features.\n",
        "\n",
        "I also explored the unique values within each feature, which helped me understand the different types of data present in the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "With the data cleaned and preprocessed, I moved on to data visualization. I used various charts, with a focus on bar charts, as they effectively visualize categorical data. I also included two popular plots, a heatmap and pairplots, to display correlations among continuous features. A heatmap provides a visual representation of the relationships between variables, while pairplots show scatter plots for all pairs of continuous variables and histograms along the diagonal.\n",
        "\n",
        "The project was completed on October 21, 2023, after a thorough exploration of the dataset and meaningful data visualizations, which will help provide valuable insights for decision-making and future analysis."

Or maybe you're curious about predicting if a hotel will get a lot of special requests? Well, this dataset about hotel bookings can help you explore those questions! It has information about bookings for both city and resort hotels, like when people booked, how long they stayed, how many adults and kids were there, and if there was parking available, among other things. We've made sure to remove any personal info from the data. So, you can dig into the data and figure out what things affect hotel bookings the most."

        "A key part of the analysis involved extensive visualization of the data using charts like bar plots, heatmaps, and pairplots. These allowed me to identify trends and relationships between variables that could provide actionable insights. For example, bar charts revealed city hotels had higher booking volumes than resort hotels.\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on the visualizations and insights uncovered, I suggested focusing marketing on city hotels, preparing for staffing needs during high demand months, implementing customer feedback surveys to improve retention, offering discounts for longer stays, and tailoring promotions by customer segment.\n",

        "The project concluded on October 21, 2023 after conducting a thorough exploratory data analysis. The visualizations and recommendations allow the client to make data-driven decisions to optimize operations, marketing, and the customer experience. Tracking the impact of these changes will reveal what works best for continued optimization.\n",
